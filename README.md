# ðŸ§  Loan Approval Prediction System

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application should be **approved** or **rejected**, based on applicant details. This project integrates **SQL**, **Flask API**, and **Logistic Regression** to build a simple, interactive web-based loan prediction tool.
